In This Project I Have Created A Nwural Network To Predict Which Type Of Breast Cancer A Patient Have using Some Features Of That Cancers
The Data Set I Used If From The Sklearn Data set:

What is sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer in Python?
In Python machine learning programming, we have software called scikit-learn. This software contains some small datasets that are very easy to access, one of which is the load_breast_cancer dataset.
Uses

This dataset uses a machine learning algorithm to classify cancer scans as benign or malignant.
Parameters

return_X_yboolean: The default value for this parameter is False.
Syntax for loading dataset

from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer


Features:
This is a binary classification dataset.

It has no Missing attribute or Null values.

The class distribution is as follows.

    212: malignant
    357: benign

This is a commonly used dataset. Machine learning papers have also used this dataset to address regression problems.

All the data types are numerical.
Code

Load the dataset:
1
2
3
4
Print data and keys

After we execute the code, we get the following.

    data: It is mostly features in the dataset that would help classify a scan as benign or malignant. It can also be called feature data.

    key: All the variable data that would help us classify a scan as benign or malignant. It is mostly the key data. For example, the data classifies the scan as benign or malignant by 1 or 0.

    target name: Name of the target variable.

    feature name: All the features available in this dataset: radius, texture, compactness, concavity, concave points, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

    DESCR: Data description.

    filename: Data is in CSV format.
